### Hi there, I'm Brian! 👋

Currently working as mobile developer focused native android and multiplatform development as React Native, at the same time undergraduate student in STEM at UFABC.

My interests are low-level programming, infrastructure, data structures, and algorithms, that is, understanding how programs and networks work.
